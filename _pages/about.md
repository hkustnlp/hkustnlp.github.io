<!-- ## About Me -->
I am a tenure-track assistant professor in [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk), [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk). 
<!-- in [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/), [John Hopcroft Center for Computer Science](http://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn/). -->
I obtained my PhD from [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu), [Language Technologies Institute](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu) in the [School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cmu.edu) in 2022, where I was co-advised by [Graham Neubig](http://www.phontron.com) and [Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~tberg/). Before that, I received the bachelor degree in Electronic Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2017. I also spent some time at Facebook AI Research (2019) and Salesforce Research (2020).  

<!-- I have interned at Facebook AI Research (2019), working with [Jiatao Gu](https://jiataogu.me) and [Marc'Aurelio Ranzato](https://ranzato.github.io); interned at Salesforce Research (2020), working with [Bryan McCann](https://bmccann.github.io); and visited Machine Learning Department of Carnegie Mellon University (2016), working with [Zhiting Hu](http://zhiting.ucsd.edu) and [Eric Xing](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~epxing/).  -->

<!-- The PhD/Mphil positions in my group has been filled up for 2024 Fall.  -->
For research assistants/visitors, at this moment I only host external visitors in exceptional cases, for example, if you have a good research background and work on projects that align with my interests well. Please drop me an email if you are interested.
<!-- I am always actively looking for strong and self-motivated students to join us! I have multiple PhD/Mphil openings starting in 2024 Fall at HKUST, as well as RA positions starting anytime. If you are interested, please drop me an email with your CV (the email subject line should include "Prospective PhD/Mphil/RA Student"). For 2024 Fall PhD/Mphil applicants, I encourage you to reach out as soon as possible to ensure consideration. I may not be able to respond to all emails, sorry.  -->

# Research
        
I am generally interested in natural language processing and machine learning. Current interests are on several aspects around large language models: 
- parameter-efficient tuning -- efficiency, modular, composition 
- multi-step reasoning
- factuality -- method and evaluation
- evaluation of foundation models -- knowledge, reasoning, tool use, etc.
- data-centric approaches 
- language model as agent


<!-- My research covers (latent-variable) generative models, controllable text generation, efficient text generation, and non-parametric language models.  -->
