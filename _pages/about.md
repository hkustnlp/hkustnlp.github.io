<!-- The HKUST NLP Group -->

Welcome to the **Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Natural Language Processing Group!** We are a diverse, collaborative community of scholars, engineers, and researchers united by our fascination with machines that can interpret, create, and engage with human communication. Our work spans both theoretical exploration and applied innovation â€“ from advancing core methodologies in **speech processing and neural language models to deploying impactful solutions in education, healthcare, and human-computer interaction**. We particularly value cross-disciplinary partnerships that bridge artificial intelligence with psychology, digital humanities, and sociolinguistics, while maintaining rigorous attention to both technical excellence and ethical considerations in language technology development.

**<span style="color: blue;">We are actively recruiting students for our PhD, MPhil, and intern positions in 2025. HKUST undergraduates are also welcome to take an independent study course with us.
